	Heap was very low.  I refactored to and was able to double free heap up to 12000.  
	The addition of the logic to run custom.lc takes me down to 7000 avg.  Still better
	than the 5000 before.  I need to revist that and see if how I can support an idea
	of an application outside of my standard MQTT framework

	Uploading some files is difficult due to low heap.  I created a safe mode.
	safe.lua or main.lua is ran by init.lua based on config option of 'save'

	In safe to go back:

	-- Sets option and saves.
	dofile("cfg.lc").setVs("save", 0)
	-- restart
	node.restart();

	This kept me from having to delete init.lua, load up wifi, etc.
	MQTT will force the unit in safe too.

	Makefile has been added.  Addjust to your upload tool
