# IDEAS and Thoughts

	cfg.lua is the largest consumer of heap.  It would be possible to refactor
	programs to use dofile("cfg.lc").getV,setVs, .. to free this space.  Downside
	is that loading data.txt consumes about .5s of time.  Each getV would consume
	that.  

	1. Don't redundantly get the same setting.  

	This requires a set, save, and restart process.

	2. For power state, don't read the config when publishing relay state

	Create a global variable and set it.  The mqtt/publish.lu can use that.
	relay.lua can do the setVs and set the global.

	3.  For some items send back the table.

	"rgb/1/XXX".  Instead of a dofile for each pin, led gets the "rgb/1" table.
	"wifi/sta/1/XXX".  Same idea
